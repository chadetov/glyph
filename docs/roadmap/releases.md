# Release roadmap (0.1.x → 1.0)

The 12-step plan in [`overview.md`](overview.md) built the toolchain — that work
is shipped. This file tracks the **feature releases** layered on top and
published to npm as `@glyphlang/glyph`. One release carries the "Next" marker and
is committed; everything after it is directional and re-sorts as we learn.

Each item keeps a rough T-shirt effort (S/M/L) and traces to a real source: the
persona-testing issue inventory, the generation follow-ups, the site's "on the
way" promises, or the standing deferrals in CLAUDE.md.

## Shipped

- **0.1.0–0.1.2** — first public preview: the language + Rust compiler, the
  standard library, the site and playground, `std/http` server, `glyph init`,
  and a wave of correctness/JSX fixes from persona testing.
- **0.1.3 — Generated types, not hand-written DTOs.** `type` is the zod
  replacement (declare a type, get a validated boundary); `glyph gen openapi`
  and `glyph gen dts` generate committed, descriptor-bearing types; the
  typed-APIs guide and the runnable REST example.
- **0.1.4 — TypeScript 7 handling for `glyph gen dts`.** A clean "install
  `typescript@6`" diagnostic instead of a cryptic crash on the native compiler.
- **0.1.5 — Typed clients and servers from your API spec.** `gen openapi
  --client`/`--handlers` and `gen zod`; untrusted input typed as `Option`
  (`header`/`query_param`) with the `put`/`patch`/`del` client verbs; `gen dts`
  resolves TypeScript from the target project first. Details and the deferred
  findings are in the section below.

## 0.1.5 — Shipped · Finish the generation / typed-API story

**Status: released.** Carried the 0.1.3/0.1.4 momentum to completion and made
the site's "on the way" promises real. Two items were deferred with findings
recorded (discriminated unions, full TS7-native `gen dts`).

- **`gen openapi` client codegen** (M) — ✅ **done.** `--client` emits one typed
  `async fn` per operation over `std/http` (typed path params + request body,
  interpolated URL, `Result<Response, HttpError>`). The full verb set
  (`get`/`post`/`put`/`patch`/`del`) shipped first as the enabler.
- **`gen openapi` handler codegen** (M) — ✅ **done.** `--handlers` emits a typed
  stub per operation plus a `route` dispatcher that matches method + path via
  array patterns over a new `http.segments(req)` (`/tasks/{id}` → `["tasks", id]`,
  binding the param). Verified routing live. Combines with `--client` (handler
  stubs are `handle_`-prefixed to stay unique).
- **Discriminated unions in generation** (M → **L, blocked on runtime rep**).
  *Finding while building the mapper:* a Glyph tagged union tags by a `tag` field
  carrying the **constructor name** (`{tag:"Cat"}`), whereas an OpenAPI
  `discriminator` selects a variant by an **arbitrary property** (`petType`)
  carrying a **string value** (`"cat"`). So a generated tagged union's descriptor
  would reject the real wire object — the same class of wire-mismatch that makes
  string enums narrow to `string`. A faithful mapping needs either a
  discriminator-aware union runtime representation or a new descriptor that reads
  a named property. Treat as its own runtime-representation task, not a mapper
  tweak; may slip past 0.1.5.
- **`gen dts` on TypeScript 7** (M/L) — 🟨 **partially done; full support
  deferred.** `gen dts` now resolves TypeScript from the *target file's own
  project* first, so a project that pins `typescript@6` (the norm) just works
  even when the global install is 7.x; diagnostics distinguish "no TypeScript"
  from "only the 7.x native port." *Finding while scouting the native API:* the
  7.x package's default export is only the version; the real API lives under
  `typescript/unstable/*` (`unstable/sync` = a project/handle-based `API`,
  `unstable/ast` = `SyntaxKind` + `is*` guards but **no `createSourceFile`**).
  Driving it for standalone `.d.ts` parsing needs the project/`Program`/
  `NodeHandle` path, which is under-documented and explicitly unstable — a real
  integration, not a tweak. Deferred past 0.1.5; the project-pin path covers the
  common case in the meantime.
- **`gen zod`** (M) — ✅ **done.** `glyph gen zod <file.ts>` executes the schema
  module via `tsx`, converts each exported zod schema to JSON Schema (zod 4's
  `z.toJSONSchema`, or `zod-to-json-schema` on zod 3), normalizes zod's
  null-union nullability into the shared mapper, and emits committed Glyph types.
  The node/tsx runner is now factored (`run_helper`) and shared with `gen dts`.
- **Untrusted input as `Option`** (M, correctness) — ✅ **done.** `http.header`
  and `http.query_param` return `Option<string>`, modeled so the exhaustiveness
  checker forces the `None` arm; a bonus fix models named-imported stdlib
  functions too, so signatures hold regardless of import style. (`Request.body`
  stays `unknown` — it's already safe-by-construction, since it can only be used
  through a descriptor's `.parse`, which rejects a missing/`null` body.)

## 0.1.6 — Shipped · Correctness & diagnostics

**Status: released.** The sharp edges first-time-user agents actually hit. All
five items shipped, led by the warning tier.

- **Warning-severity diagnostics** (M, unblocker) — ✅ **done.** Diagnostics now
  carry a severity (`Error`/`Warning`); the renderer picks ReportKind + color by
  it, and `glyph build` tracks errors separately so a warning is surfaced without
  failing the build or blocking emission.
- **`Result` must-use warning** (S) — ✅ **done.** E0217 warns when a
  `Result`-typed expression is used as a *non-final* statement (so its `Err` is
  discarded). Scoped to non-final statements to never mistake a match-arm block's
  tail value for a drop; silent across every example.
- **Source-mapped `tsc` errors** (L, high value) — ✅ **done.** The emitter emits
  a coarse source map (`(byte offset, Glyph span)` per declaration and top-level
  statement, shifted past the prepended import header); the CLI parses tsc's
  `path(line,col): error TSxxxx` output, maps each position to a Glyph span, and
  re-renders it against `.glyph` with an ariadne caret (keeping the TS code).
  Statement-level granularity; lambda-body errors map to the enclosing statement.
  Unattributable lines (stdlib `.ts`, summaries) pass through. Wired into both
  `build --check` and `run`.
- **Nested record-payload whole-ident bind** (S) — ✅ **done.** `Err(BadQty(b))`
  binding a whole record payload in a nested match emitted `.value` (which the
  flattened `{tag, ...fields}` object lacks) and `tsc`-errored. Fixed by
  recording the synthesized grouping temp's payload type in an emitter side
  table so the inner match binds the whole object.
- **`\${...}` template-literal escaping** (M) — ✅ **done.** A literal `\${` now
  stays literal via an internal escaped-`$` marker + a char-aware template
  splitter; the same rewrite fixed non-ASCII template text being mangled. (A
  nested string literal *inside* `${...}` still needs a `let` hoist — the full
  lexer template-literal mode remains a v1.1 item.)

## 0.1.7 — Shipped · Works with React, speaks to agents

**Status: released (with a 0.1.8 hotfix, below).** All 15 brainstormed items
landed, built in adoption-rank order (1 → 15), each with tests. Full plan and
per-item testing strategy: [`../plan/0.1.7-language-and-agent-experience.md`](../plan/0.1.7-language-and-agent-experience.md).

**0.1.8 — Shipped · hotfix.** The published platform binaries lost their Unix
execute bit (GitHub artifact upload/download strips it), so `npx @glyphlang/glyph`
failed with `EACCES` — a latent bug in every release through 0.1.7. Fixed by
having the launcher `chmod 0o755` the binary before spawn and the release
workflow restore `+x` before publish; verified against the published package from
a clean npx cache.

1. **JSX fragments `<>...</>`** (S/M) — ✅ **done.** Parser (`<`-then-`>`
   lookahead + `</>` close, empty-name element), resolver/emitter `Fragment`
   kind → `React.createElement(React.Fragment, ...)`, formatter round-trips.
2. **Member-expression JSX `<Ns.Comp>`** (S/M) — ✅ **done.** `jsx_element_name`
   parses dotted tag names; resolver resolves the base segment; emitter uses the
   dotted string as the `createElement` type. React Context providers work.
3. **Machine-readable diagnostics (`--json`)** (M) — ✅ **done.** `glyph build
   --json` emits a JSON object (ok/errors/warnings/tsc/emitted + a `diagnostics`
   array with code, severity, message, file, 1-based line/col range, stage, help,
   note). A structured `Diagnostic` is built at every diagnostic site, and
   remapped tsc errors are included pointing at the Glyph source.
4. **Runtime source maps** (M/L) — ✅ **done.** Every emitted `.ts` ships a
   standard v3 `.ts.map` (VLQ, `sourcesContent` embedded) + a `sourceMappingURL`
   comment, built from the emitter checkpoints. A debugger or bundler chaining
   maps traces the `.ts` back to `.glyph`. (Boundary: `glyph run`'s own stack
   still shows `.ts` — tsx doesn't chain the map through its `.ts`→`.js`
   transform; remapping the run stack is a follow-up.)
5. **`gen dts` on TypeScript 7 native API** (M/L) — ✅ **done.** Drives the
   `typescript/unstable/sync` API (open file → inferred project → program →
   source file) with `unstable/ast`'s `SyntaxKind`; one walker handles both the
   classic (5/6) and native (7) compilers via a small toolkit (the native AST's
   missing `questionToken` is detected from the member text). The deferred 0.1.5
   finding is resolved.
6. **Bounded generics `<T: Bound>`** (M) — ✅ **done.** Parser records the bound
   (single bound in v1); emitter lowers it to a TS `extends` clause that tsc
   enforces, so a violated bound is caught and mapped back to the `.glyph` call
   site.
7. **Discriminated-union generation** (L) — ✅ **done.** The deferred 0.1.5
   finding, resolved manifesto-safely by generating code, not changing the
   language: a discriminated `oneOf` emits a Glyph tagged union of the variants
   plus a `parse_<Name>` dispatcher that reads the discriminator property (via a
   new `std/json.discriminant`) and validates into the right variant. Verified
   the generated union compiles, dispatches a real wire object, and is
   idempotent.
8. **Shared-state / store pattern** (M, design first) — ✅ **done.** A new
   `std/store`: `create(initial)` returns a `Store<T>` with `get`/`set`/`update`.
   A module-level `const s = create(...)` gives many functions one shared state
   without a `let` in `main` or capturing closures — and needs no rule relaxed,
   since the `const` binding never moves (D20) and no `mut` reassignment is
   involved (D5); only the store's internal value changes, through a greppable
   `.set`/`.update` method call. Design note + guide in
   [`../guide/shared-state.md`](../guide/shared-state.md); a corpus program and a
   build test cover it; the codegen-style answer page (08) is on the site.
9. **More warning-tier lints** (S each) — ✅ **done.** Three advisory warnings
   (never block the build): unused import (E0106), unused `let` (E0107, `_`
   exempt), and unreachable code after `return`/`break`/`continue` (E0108).
   Computed in a self-contained `module_lints` pass that runs only on
   error-free modules and reads the authoritative resolution map for usage, so
   incompleteness can only miss a lint, never invent one. Building the examples
   surfaced (and we removed) four genuinely-dead imports. *Bug found and fixed
   in passing:* template interpolations were parsed from offset 0, so adjacent
   `${a} ${b}` produced colliding spans that overwrote each other in the
   resolution map — silently dropping a resolution (and breaking go-to-def/
   rename inside templates). Fixed by offsetting each interpolation's parse.
   Exact byte-accurate template spans still need a lexer template-literal mode
   (v1.1); the offset is unique, which is what the resolution map requires.
10. **number/string value-match exhaustiveness** (M) — ✅ **done.** A `match` on
    a `number`/`string` with only literal arms is now E0218: those domains are
    unbounded, so it can never be exhaustive, and the emitter's `switch`
    `default` would throw at runtime. Requires an `else` (or a bare-identifier
    binding). Detected by the scrutinee's static type or recovered from a
    literal arm (mirroring the bool checker). Unit tests, a negative case, error
    catalogue + `--explain` entry.
11. **`glyph regen`** (M, Q40) — ✅ **done.** Every file `glyph gen` writes
    already carried its exact invocation in the header; that line is now
    complete (`--out` + flags) and machine-runnable. `glyph regen [path]` scans
    a dir/file for those headers, dedupes the commands, and re-runs each once,
    so a spec change flows into the committed Glyph with one command. Idempotent
    and deterministic; runs from the project root where recorded relative paths
    resolve. *Scope note:* this is Q40 Option B's deterministic half — refresh
    generated code from a spec. The sketch's other half (an LLM regenerating a
    `@generate` *body* from a prompt) is inherently non-deterministic and stays
    out of a tested v1 command; deferred. Rust unit + integration tests (full
    gen → edit spec → regen → idempotent-rerun cycle).
12. **`@redact` full enforcement** (M, D24) — ✅ **done.** `@redact fields:
    [...]` on a record type now (a) is validated: an unknown field name is E0219
    (masking a non-existent field would be a silent no-op), and (b) emits a
    `redact(value)` method on the type's runtime descriptor that returns a
    serialization-safe copy with those fields replaced by a `[REDACTED]`
    sentinel — so `json.stringify(User.redact(u))` masks the PII. The masking is
    additive to the descriptor (it never touches `is`/`parse`/`schema`, which is
    what a prior attempt broke), so the descriptor tests stayed green. Shared
    `glyph_ast::redact_fields` single-sources the `fields: [...]` parse for the
    typechecker and emitter. Integration test (masked output + E0219), a negative
    case, error catalogue + `--explain`. *Honest scope:* enforcement is via the
    explicit `T.redact(value)` descriptor method, not fully-automatic boundary
    interception (masking every `json.stringify`/log call would need a runtime
    type tag on values); that automatic form is future work. Related gap noticed:
    the D27 "unknown annotation is a hard error" rule is documented but not
    enforced yet — parked below.
13. **`glyph build --out X` cleans stale files first** (S) — ✅ **done.** The
    G17 stale-`.ts` prune already removed orphaned emitted modules; it now also
    prunes their `.ts.map` source-map sidecars (item 4 added those after G17), so
    a renamed/removed module leaves no orphan map either. A `.ts.map` is kept iff
    its `.ts` is; unrelated files the user placed in the out dir are preserved.
    Integration test (rename a module, rebuild, old `.ts`+`.ts.map` gone, user
    file kept).
14. **Extend the targeted type hint** (S) — ✅ **done.** The `boolean`→`bool`
    style "did you mean the Glyph spelling" hint on an unresolved name now also
    covers `int`/`Int`/`integer`/`float`/`double` → `number`, `any` → `unknown`
    (narrow via `.parse`/`match`), and `Promise` → "an `async fn` returns `T`
    directly." Unit tests.
15. **Nested nullary-in-object parser bug** (S) — ✅ **done.** A union with no
    leading `|` whose *first* variant carried a payload
    (`type W = Wrap({ inner: Inner }) | Empty`, or a lone `type W = Wrap(P)`)
    failed to parse — the type-decl body read `Wrap` as a plain type and choked
    on the `(`. `parse_type_decl_body` now promotes a payload-carrying first
    atom to a variant and continues as a union. Parser tests for both shapes;
    the emitted match lowers and passes tsc --strict.

## 0.1.10 — Shipped · Make the verifiability guarantee match the pitch

**Status: shipped.** From a deep code-level review (the "Linus" pass). The
review confirmed the compiler is real and several decisions tasteful, but caught
the marketing overclaiming relative to what the code guarantees — and the code's
own doc-comments were more honest than the site. The honesty fixes shipped with
0.1.9's tail (home card + verifiability pillar reworded from "no casts / no
erasure / true at runtime" to what's actually true: no `any`/`as` in source,
exhaustive `match`, strict validators for declared types, an enforced strict
dialect over `tsc`; the pillar now owns the `tsc` dependency and names the
generic edges). 0.1.10 closes the engineering behind them:

- **`infer_shape` for schema combinators** (L, Q40/substep-5b, D28) — ✅ **done.**
  `object_schema<Shape: Record<string, Schema<unknown>>>(shape) -> Schema<infer_shape<Shape>>`
  now derives the output type from the shape. `infer_shape<S>` is a narrow
  built-in type-level operator (not the full TS mapped-/conditional-type surface):
  it lowers to one per-module `type __GlyphInferShape<S> = { [K in keyof S]: S[K] extends Schema<infer V> ? V : never }`,
  and `tsc` reduces and enforces it at each call site. A shape that omits a field
  of the annotated type now fails to compile (regression-tested end to end,
  mapped back to Glyph source). The flagship `01_validator.glyph` dropped its
  hand-synced `<Out>`. See spec D28.
- **Prove or remove the generic-return `as` cast** (M) — ✅ **done, resolved to
  "narrow."** The empirical finding: the blanket cast was never legitimately
  needed. For honest generics (`identity<T> -> T`, `array_schema<T> -> Schema<Array<T>>`)
  it was pure noise TS proves on its own; the one place it was load-bearing was
  masking the `object_schema` unsoundness. It now fires *only* when the return
  type mentions `infer_shape` — the single case a combinator assembles a value of
  a shape-derived type from `unknown`. Every honest generic emits cast-free.
- **Formatter dropped generic bounds** (S) — ✅ **fixed as a side-catch.** `glyph fmt`
  silently discarded `<T: Bound>` (D28's `object_schema<Shape: Record<...>>` was
  the first program to exercise it), which changed the emitted TS. The formatter
  now round-trips bounds; caught by the round-trip semantics test.
- **Generic-type descriptors** (L) — ✅ **done.** A generic record type
  (`Paginated<T>`) now emits a descriptor whose `is`/`parse` take one runtime
  checker per type parameter (`__is_T`). `Paginated.parse<User>(v)` and
  `match v { is Paginated<User> => ... }` validate the payload *deeply* — each
  element is checked as a `User`, not just for presence — the compiler
  synthesizes the checker from the type argument at the call site (reusing the
  recursive `field_value_check`, the same machinery `json.parse<T>` routing uses).
  A generic descriptor omits the `.schema` member (a `Schema<Paginated<T>>`
  factory would need the checker threaded too). Function-typed fields were also
  tightened from presence to `typeof === "function"`.
- **Imported-type descriptors** (M) — still open. A type from an external
  `.d.ts` you only reference carries no descriptor, so a field of that type is
  presence-checked. Materializing it with `glyph gen dts` gives it one; a
  first-class path (validate against the `.d.ts` structure directly) is future
  work. This is the one remaining `T.parse` honest edge.
- **Strengthen `definitely_incompatible`** (M) — ✅ **done.** The conservative
  assignability relation now judges three shape pairs it used to punt to `tsc`,
  each proven-only (no false positives): a concrete scalar
  (`string`/`number`/`bool`) against a record or function type in either
  direction; two function types whose return types are incompatible (return
  covariance; `void` skipped for the un-annotated-lambda stub and callback
  contravariance); and two structural records with an incompatible shared field
  or a missing required field. Passing `5` where a `fn(number) -> number` is
  expected, or a `string`-returning function where a `number`-returning one is,
  is now caught at the Glyph level (E0211) instead of only by `tsc`. Record-vs
  record is sound but mostly latent until object-literal argument inference
  improves (today those infer to `Unknown` and stay permissive).

## 0.1.11 — Next · The editor & agent integration surface

**Status: proposed.** 0.1.10 made the language itself trustworthy; this release
widens how editors and agents *reach* it. The language server already ships
(`glyph lsp` over stdio: diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, completion,
symbols, formatting); these are the two most-requested gaps on top of it.

- **Rename + find-references in the LSP** (M) — ✅ **done, workspace-wide.**
  `textDocument/references` and `textDocument/rename` ship. A binding is
  identified canonically: a file-local binding by its def-site, a module-level
  symbol by `(module path, name)` — where the module path is the file's own for
  a declaration, or the import's for an imported name — so every file agrees on
  one identity. Find-references and rename now span the whole workspace: a
  module-level rename edits the declaration, every reference, and each importing
  module's `import` binding, and validates the new name (legal identifier,
  non-keyword) first. Local bindings stay file-scoped (they can't cross files).
- **Cross-file workspace index for the LSP** (L) — ✅ **done (on-demand).** The
  server parses+resolves every `.glyph` file under the root (preferring open
  buffers, including unsaved files) and cross-references them by global identity.
  This is what makes the workspace-wide references/rename above complete. Honest
  scope: the index is rebuilt per request rather than cached (an optimization for
  later), and a file that doesn't parse is skipped. Caching + incrementality, and
  extending the same cross-file resolution to go-to-definition, are the
  follow-ups.
- **First-party MCP server exposing the language server** (M) — an agent-facing
  bridge so a coding agent can query Glyph's own understanding of a codebase
  (hover types, go-to-definition, references, workspace symbols, live
  diagnostics) as MCP tools, instead of only reading `glyph build --json`. The
  server reuses the `glyph-lsp` analysis layer (which already has no `tower-lsp`
  types — it is a plain, testable in-memory analyzer), so the MCP surface is a
  thin adapter over the same queries the editor path uses, not a second
  implementation. Sequenced after rename/references so the reference/symbol
  queries exist to expose. Complements the existing agent path (`glyph llms` /
  `AGENTS.md` for the spec, `glyph build --json` for coded diagnostics) rather
  than replacing it. Requested by an early user.

## Verifiability hardening — Linus 2nd-pass follow-ups

**Status: from the second deep code-level review.** The review verified 0.1.10
against the source and granted the "grudging nod" (the honesty fixes are real,
the engineering is real, `definitely_incompatible` is good taste). It left four
concrete follow-ups, in priority order:

- **Don't let `tsc` be optional for the guarantee we advertise** (M) — `glyph run`
  type-checks with `tsc` by default, but if `tsc` is not on `PATH` it prints a
  warning and runs anyway (`glyph-cli/src/run.rs`). That quietly downgrades the
  soundness story on a box without `tsc`. Make the skip loud and non-zero-exit,
  or require `tsc` for the checked path, so the guarantee never evaporates
  silently. (`glyph build --check` and CI already hard-fail; this is the `run`
  path.)
- **Rename and generalize `infer_shape`** (M) — ✅ **done.** The operator was
  welded to the literal type name `Schema` (the emitted mapped type said
  `S[K] extends Schema<infer V>`), so a validator type named anything else
  silently mapped every field to `never`. Renamed to **`infer_output`** (honest:
  it derives the output types the parsers produce) and generalized to match a
  parser field **structurally** — any `{ parse(input: unknown) -> Result<V, _> }`,
  reading the `Ok` payload out of the result's wire form — so it is independent of
  the wrapper's name (a user's own `Codec<T>` works too, pinned by an integration
  test). The one boundary cast now fires on `infer_output` returns. See spec D28.
- **Prove the `tsc`-error source remap in a test** (S) — the `infer_shape` bite
  integration test asserts only that `tsc` *failed*, not that the diagnostic maps
  back onto the `.glyph` line, while the commit message claims "mapped back to
  Glyph source." The remap works (verified manually); strengthen the test to
  assert the diagnostic lands on the Glyph source span so the claim is pinned.
- **Close the imported-`.d.ts` presence-only hole** (M) — already tracked as the
  one remaining `T.parse` honest edge (see the 0.1.10 imported-type-descriptors
  item). Reaffirmed as the softest spot in the runtime story: an imported type is
  checked for presence only until materialized with `glyph gen dts`.

## Rolling · Ergonomics & polish

The former rolling-lane items (`--out` cleanup, store pattern, `@redact`,
`glyph regen`) are now scoped into 0.1.7 above. New small wins that surface later
land here until they're assigned a release.

## Parked (v2 / later)

- **D27 unknown-annotation rejection.** The spec says an unknown `@<name>`
  annotation is a hard error, but the typechecker doesn't enforce it yet (a
  `@bogus` is silently ignored). Add a recognized-annotation dispatch table.
- **Automatic `@redact` boundary masking.** Today redaction is via the explicit
  `T.redact(value)` descriptor method; masking every serialize/log call
  automatically needs a runtime type tag on values.
- `@ffi target:` syntax (v2).
- General TS mapped-/conditional-type surface (`{ [K in keyof T]: ... }`,
  `X extends Y ? A : B`, user-written `infer`). Deliberately *not* shipped: the
  narrow `infer_shape<S>` operator (D28, 0.1.10) covers the schema-derivation
  case without the unreadable, hard-to-grep general machinery. Revisit only if a
  concrete need outside schema derivation appears.
- `owned` closure-capture soundness (needs real capture analysis).
- Self-hosting (a v1.0 non-goal).

---

*Sequencing note:* 0.1.5 is committed; the 0.1.6/0.1.7 split and the rolling lane
are a proposal, ordered by dependency (warning tier before must-use, etc.). We
re-sort at each release boundary.
